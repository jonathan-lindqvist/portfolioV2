I recently went through some old book purchases I made and found *Foundations of Information Security* by Jason Andress. I just finished it, and it was alright. To clarify, it is not a bad book, but for me it would have been better if I had read it earlier. As the name suggests, it is a book that covers the basics, and it does so in about 250 pages. Since I have been interested in cybersecurity for some time now, there was not a lot of new information for me.

# Why read a foundational book now?
When I started studying for the SSCP exam, I was looking for something that I could easily read on the go. I also wanted a reminder of the basics and a way to find any gaps I might have, and for that I would say it fit the description. For example, I am not confident in the extended concepts around the CIA triad, and it was nice to remind myself of them. I also wanted to know more about incident response, which the book covers.

# Who is it for?
Reasonably, I do not recommend the book for a seasoned professional. That can more or less be figured out from the title. I do recommend it to people who want to understand what information security is, someone who is just getting started in cybersecurity, and anyone planning to read it **before** starting to study for the SSCP exam. This is because it gives a nice overview of many fields within information security, so it is a good starting point to figure out where to begin a deep dive. That is one reason why I might return to the book again in the future.

However, there is one thing that I do not like about it. At times it can make defenses sound trivial. For example, when the book talks about directory traversal, it says: “*In many cases, filtering out special characters, such as the ones described and *, %, ‘, ;, and / will defeat such attacks entirely.*” This makes it sound really simple. I do understand that the general idea is to validate and filter input, but there are many ways to do it, and they are not equally good.

# Final thoughts
Overall, I see this book as a compact refresher and a solid entry point rather than a deep technical guide. If you are early in your cybersecurity journey, it gives you a map of the landscape. If you already have experience, it works better as a checklist to revisit fundamentals and spot weak areas. For me, it served as a reminder that even basic material is worth revisiting, especially when preparing for certifications or trying to structure existing knowledge.
