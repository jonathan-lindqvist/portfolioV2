Learned optimism by Martin Seligman was the first self-improvement and psychology book I read a few years ago that genuinely hooked me. I generally find most self-help books cliché and of limited value. Either this is actually the case, or I have not found enough of the good ones. Either way, this book stands out. It has become one of my favorites and one I have recommended often.

If there is one core takeaway from the book, it is the distinction between viewing events as temporary versus permanent. Seligman explains how people interpret setbacks and successes differently, and how these interpretations shape long-term outcomes. It is basically how we humans view events in life. 

What he found was that less successful and more depressed people tend to view negative events as permanent and internal. They believe failures reflect who they are. Happier and more successful people, on the other hand, tend to see negative events as temporary and external. A pessimistic student blames themselves and concludes they are stupid. If that same student later succeeds, they attribute it to luck. A student with a healthier mindset reacts differently. When they fail, they blame external factors such as lack of preparation or time, and see the failure as temporary. When they succeed, they attribute it to their ability and effort, and view it as something permanent. 

Seligman could see the same patterns in other situations as well, such as in offices, sports and politics. It is also worth noting that the mindset can be "inhertied" by children as they listen and observe their parents, so depending on the parent's mindset, the child will probably grow up and have a similar mindset.
